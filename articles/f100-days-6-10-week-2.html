            <p>My first job out of college was working at JPMorgan's investment bank in Manhattan.</p>
            <p>
              I started out on a project for the Debt Capital Markets desk in what was called "the bubble," a glass room
              on a trading floor to separate us from the traders since we had "MNPI." Even though it was
              <em>incredibly cool</em>
              to take the train to Grand Central Station and use the special underground tunnel that took me right into
              what used to be Bear Stearns' building on Maddison Avenue, the day to day of being in the bubble wasn't
              all that fun.
            </p>
            <p>It was kinda like going to work at a library.</p>
            <p>
              The project was only a temporary gig, meaning it was on me to find a long term position at the bank if I
              wanted to stay. Knowing that I wanted to do something less "nerdy", I decided to start making moves.
              Thanks to a professional gambit that we'll save for another time, I was able to finagle an interview with
              Matt Zames, the COO for all of JPMorgan at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
              The meeting couldn't have lasted more than 15 minutes, but I left with a few nuggets of wisdom I've taken
              with me ever since. One of these insights was about "drawing a box around the problem."
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading mb-4">Draw A Box Around The Problem</h2>
            <p>
              In giving me the cliffnotes story of how he became the COO, he mentioned that a guy by the name of Jamie
              Diamond asked him if he'd be able to help get things under control during the financial crisis of 2008.
              Matt said that Jamie thought he'd be able solve some of the bank's most pressing issues, and it was
              largely thanks to the reputation he had been building as a serious, serious problem solver.
            </p>
            <p>
              Being top of mind for a mission critical problem in an organization of ~250k people that all but dictates
              the direction of the world's financial markets is no small feat. According to Matt, he had a super simple
              philosophy to solving problems that were anything but simple.
            </p>
            <p>Step one: He drew a box around the problem.</p>
            <h2 class="section-heading mb-4">Drawing A Box Around My Problem</h2>
            <p>
              The reason he told me about Jamie Diamond asking him if he could solve the problem was probably the best
              display of a professional wingman I had ever seen, and it continues to be the greatest example of
              professional wingmanship I've seen to date.
            </p>
            <p>
              He was about to announce that he had just tapped the current head of DCM, James Lansing, the same man who
              had hired me to the project I was currently working on, to lead a new group they were establishing called
              "Global Strategy And Infrastructure." The goal of the group was to basically help put a box around the
              regulatory issues facing all of JPM's 5 lines of business, and he said "James thinks you can help him
              solve some of these problems. He's going to ask you to join his team. Do you think that's a good idea?"
            </p>
            <p>"Yes, Sir!"</p>
            <p>And that's how I got a start my start in the world of corporate strategy.</p>
