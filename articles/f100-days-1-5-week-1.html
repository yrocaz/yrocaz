            <p>
              My biggest takeaway from my first week with a VA was a reminder of a lesson I learned half of my lifetime
              ago.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve always fancied myself a leader. Even as a young boy at recess I was choosing the teams more often
              than I was being chosen to join them, and this was despite being skinnier than most of the kids around me.
              In 6th grade I ran for class president even though I was the new kid that year, meaning I had really only
              known my classmates for a few weeks at that point, and believe it or not I won.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of this is to say that I had the whole leadership thing figured out pretty early. As far as I was
              concerned the formula to becoming a leader was as simple as taking charge of any given situation and poof!
              You’re the leader. Right!? Well, i took that understanding with me when I joined the United States Marine
              Corps Infantry, and it didn’t take long to realize that it wasn’t so simple.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wouldn’t say that I was a bad leader per se, but that’s only because I’m taking advantage of a
              historical loophole. The reality was I was rarely given the opportunity to lead at all early on in my
              career, and it was precisely because I did not embody many good leadership qualities (plus it was much,
              much harder to overcome being skinny!).
            </p>
            <p>
              If I could distill all of my leadership advice from the Marines into a single sentence it would probably
              be to “just start leading people because it will force you to become a better leader.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course there are other ways to go about it and an infinite number of resources to help cut the learning
              curve, but you won’t begin to embody leadership qualities until you’ve borne the weight of a leader’s
              responsibilities. Ask anyone who’s ever been responsible for other people’s wellbeing and/or hopes and
              dreams, whether that’s a parent, coach, team captain, or business owner, and they’ll all tell you that
              that responsibility changes the game. If you’re in one of these positions yourself then you already know.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve implemented more automations and workflows to help manage my business in these past 5-days than I
              have in the past 5 months, and it’s all thanks to the added responsibility of needing to properly and
              responsibly employ Gen, my VA.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gen walked into a disorganized mess, and that was a very direct, very poor reflection on how I had been
              running my companies. Not a fun pill to swallow. It’s easy to say that you can get away with some
              disorganization as a solo shop, and you can to a point, but you can’t grow without the right systems in
              place.
            </p>
            <p>
              I hired Gen so I could focus on growing my business, so there were no more excuses to delay implementing
              systems. Hiring her also means that I have a responsibility to set her up for success and empower her to
              handle as much of the day to day operations as possible without me, which leads me to the final point
              about this first week.
            </p>
            <p>
              An unfortunately recurring theme in my business struggles to date has been my failure to assemble the
              right team. Knowing I needed to hire someone who could effectively replace me in a client-facing role, I
              took the advice of my good friend Rodrigo (who has been telling me to get a VA since the day we met), and
              went with a professional (read: expensive) VA management company. Your mileage may vary, but I have no
              regrets.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not only is Gen an absolute pro, she’s also proactive. Even though she came into a disorganized mess,
              she’s already helping me bring order to the chaos and addressing issues she sees without being asked. As
              our friend Jim Collins would say, Gen is the right person to be on the bus.
            </p>
            <p>
              To reference another great leadership concept, John Maxwell’s
              <a href="https://www.johnmaxwell.com/blog/the-law-of-the-lid/" target="_blank">Law Of The Lid</a>, forcing
              myself to spend the money and interview enough candidates to find an A player is a practice I will make a
              rule from here on out.
            </p>
            <p>
              So! Even though there have been some really cool external changes (she’s already setting appointments for
              me, I learned to delegate email access, she created a new banner for our facebook page, etc) the biggest
              difference, the one I thought was worth talking about to hopefully inspire you to take the leap, was
              internal.
            </p>
            <p>In summary! My takeaways from the first 5 days are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Taking on more leadership responsibilities has boosted my productivity and raised the stakes to help get
                things done.
              </li>
              <li>
                It’s still very early, but it’s not my first time having someone help out with my endeavors. From what
                I’ve seen of the VA company’s onboarding process, the candidates they selected for me to interview, and
                Gen’s work product and work ethic this past week, you get what you pay for. I’m going to officially
                raise my standards.
              </li>
              <li>
                Needing to assign Gen meaningful tasks has highlighted the many inefficiencies in my current processes,
                which is helping to improve just about everything.
              </li>
              <li>I’m building out many of the processes from scratch with Gen’s help for 3 reasons:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  I think it’s a great way to develop our working relationship. This is a make or break dynamic for our
                  continued success, so it's very much worth “slowing down to speed up.”
                </li>
                <li>
                  It’s giving her an intimate understanding of the businesses. This is important because it will
                  ultimately empower her to take ownership and help us cut the time it will take to make confident,
                  correct judgment calls without me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Just as I am always striving to level up as a leader, my goal is to level her up as well. We are
                  documenting everything we do so that she can eventually train her replacement as she takes on more
                  responsibilities in the future.
                </li>
              </ul>
