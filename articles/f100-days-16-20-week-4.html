            <p>
              I'll start with a confession: even though I'm writing this article "as scheduled" on Saturday of week 4, I
              was not able finish week 2's article on time and I didn't even get to start week 3's.
            </p>
            <p>
              The TLDR of what I planned to write for week 3 was that hiring someone to free up my time has actually
              made me busier than ever. That feeling has continued into this week, and it's mostly thanks to the
              inordinate amount of time I've been spending formalizing the ad-hoc processes I've been running on my own
              to date.
            </p>
            <p>
              Astute readers will understand that what I'm actually saying is that I've been creating these processes
              from scratch since I've been wingin' it until now, and the unfortunate reality is that I've had to do this
              <em>on top of</em> everything else it takes to run and grow my businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
              As necessary as this exercise may be (it's very hard to delegate when everything lives in your head), it
              takes it's toll on you!

            <h2 class="section-heading mb-4">Slowing Down To Speed Up</h2>
            <p>
              One of the processes/campaigns I set up for Gen to follow was a 9-touch system to schedule office visits,
              and those efforts started to pay off this week.
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea is to give a no-strings-attached masterclass about market activity for that office's top County
              by presenting the info using the Ruiz Report. If they like what they see then they can sign up, and if not
              then at least they'll leave smarter than when they came in. Think of it as in-person content marketing
              with a legitimate value add for the office because training agents + math = hard (at least it is without
              our reports!).
            </p>
            <p>
              After a grand total of 220 emails and 70 follow up calls,
              <strong>we scheduled our first office visit this week!</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              The important thing to note is that <em>we</em> got this office appointment while <em>I</em> was writing
              code, meeting with clients, and recording training videos. This is of course the royal <em>we</em> because
              Gen booked this appointment all by herself.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have the fact that we slowed down to set things up correctly to thank for this first of many victories.
              I'm effectively out of the way for office outreach, and if all goes well Gen will be able to pass this off
              to the next person thanks to our SOPs and documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was 100% on me to put these first systems in place since there was no way for Gen to understand my
              business well enough to do it herself, but that model is slowly coming to an end as well.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading mb-4">It's All About Leverage</h2>
            <p>
              Gen has now taken ownership of this processes and we'll be able to optimize based on her real world
              experiences from here on out.
            </p>
            <p>
              She's also learning the business well enough to start creating her own processes to fill in the gaps, and
              that's where things should really start to take off.
            </p>
            <p>
              Realtors are notoriously difficult to get a hold of, and a huge failing of mine to date has been using
              that as an excuse for my lackluster direct marketing efforts. From my experience thus far I'd say that 290
              <em>data-driven touches,</em> meaning fully personalized messages that include the office's production
              stats and other relevant info, to <em><u>one</u></em> office appointment seems about right ðŸ˜³.
            </p>
            <p>What I see as a hassle, Gen sees as a welcomed challenge.</p>
            <p>
              Using language I learned from the
              <a href="https://freetofocus.com/makeover/resources/freedom-compass.pdf" target="_blank"
                >Freedom Compass</a
              >, I've moved something from my drudgery zone into someone else's desire zone.
            </p>
            <p>It's all starting to come together.</p>
